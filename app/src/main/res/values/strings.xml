        versus regularly brewed coffee.\n\nBecause they are made with a shot of water instead of a liter of water per cup of ground coffee, espressos are basically
        highly concentrated coffee. Because of this, you can expect espressos to have a more heightened array of flavors compared to a regular cup of coffee.\n\nThis
        can mean stronger, toastier, and more bitter cups, which flavors that will be amplified depending on the coffee roast. Regardless, you can expect thicker and
        creamier textures than coffee, almost like what you see with cappuccinos.\n\nLike with other variations of coffee, there are health benefits when drinking a

        the two drinks; however: while cappuccinos have equal ratios, lattes have more steamed milk.\nThe ingredients in lattes are also mixed together instead of
        being layered, like what can be found in cappuccinos. Compared to cappuccinos and the many other espresso-based drinks, lattes are not very strong in taste.

        as sweet as you will find in mochas.\n\nAlso, while cappuccinos are frothy due to the milk foam, lattes are creamy and smooth thanks to the extra helping of
        steamed milk.\n\nA cup a day can aid in burning fat, and with more natural flavors such as beetroot or turmeric, you can improve your memory and relieve

        other as it is.\n\nThe more popular macchiatos bear the most similarities with lattes because they are both heavies with milk.\nPopular drizzles to add to
        the creamy drink are vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut.\n\nThe difference between macchiatos and its counterparts is the order in which the ingredients are
        added.\n\nFor example, lattes add milk to the espresso, but macchiatos do the reverse: espresso is added to milk. In terms of taste, it is generally agreed
        that macchiatos are more aromatic, and are considered a fair compromise between the strength of espresso and the lighter touch of a cappuccino.\n\nThe
        espresso macchiatos have a generally bolder and richer taste than cappuccinos, while the latte macchiatos make for fair competitors with lattes in terms
        of sweet, creamy goodness.\nThe benefits of drinking macchiatos include preventing high blood pressure, maintaining liver health, and promoting weight loss.</string>
